Tyrion Lannister, a member of House Lannister, is known for his dwarfism and intellect. He's the youngest child of Tywin and Joanna Lannister and is often looked down upon by his family, especially his father and sister Cersei, due to his stature. Despite facing prejudice, Tyrion is highly intelligent, witty, and has a talent for politics.
He is close to Jaime but his sister and father resent him because his mother, Joanna, died giving him birth.

Tyrion gave Jeoffrey a ValyrianSteel dagger with a Dragonbone hilt as a gift.
Tyrion visited the Wall and met Eddard's bastard son, Jon.
He spoke to Jeor Mormont, who told him that the enemy beyond the wall is awaking and asked him to convince the court to send help.
Catelyn Stark arrested Tyrion, accusing him of attempting to murder Bran Stark.
Catelyn's accusation was based on the fact that the weapon used by the assassin was traced back to Tyrion (but in fact, Tyrion had given it to Jeoffrey earlier).
Tyrion was taken to the Eyrie by Catelyn and put on trial.
He demanded a trial by combat and was freed when Bronn fought for him.
Tyrion joined his father Tywin Lannister's war efforts against Stark.
Tyrion was appointed as acting Hand by Tywin.
