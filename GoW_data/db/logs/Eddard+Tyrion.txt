Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion, but it was Catelyn's love for her family that led her to act, not a lack of truth or honor.

QUD: What do you think would have been the implications for the North if Jon had stayed in Winterfell instead of joining the Night's Watch, Eddard?

<resolved> | The truth can be a dangerous weapon if misused or wielded by those with ill intentions.
QUD: Tyrion, you mentioned the misuse of truth. Can you recall a specific instance where you've seen this happen, perhaps in your own experiences?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion, but consider this: when I confronted Cersei about her children's parentage, her intentions were to protect her family, yet the truth she wielded led to my arrest.

QUD: 
Tyrion: Ah, Eddard, but wasn't it your pursuit of truth that led to your arrest, not Cersei's intentions?

QUD: Tyrion, you mentioned the misuse of truth. Can you recall a specific instance where you've seen this happen, perhaps in your own experiences?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion, my pursuit of truth did lead to my arrest. But, wasn't it Petyr's deceit that truly sealed my fate?
