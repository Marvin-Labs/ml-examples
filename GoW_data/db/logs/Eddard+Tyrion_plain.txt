Eddard: eddard: Tell me what's on your mind, tyrion.
Tyrion: Well, Eddard, I've been navigating the treacherous waters of politics in the South. How fares the North?
Eddard: The North remains steadfast, Tyrion. And you, how do you fare amidst the southern intrigues?
Tyrion: The South is a snake pit, Eddard. But a snake can't bite a stone, can it?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion, but even a stone can be worn down by time and constant pressure. How do you manage to stay unscathed?
Tyrion: I've learned to dance with the snakes, Eddard. How about you, how do you keep the wolves at bay in the North?
Eddard: I stand by my principles, Tyrion. They guide me through the harshest winters. How do you find your dance with the snakes?
Tyrion: It's a delicate dance, Eddard. One must know when to lead and when to follow.
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. But in your dance, have you found moments of rest or does the music play incessantly?
Tyrion: Rest, Eddard? In this dance, the music is the silence between the notes.
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion, silence can be as telling as the notes themselves. How do you interpret these silences in your dance?
Tyrion: Silences, Eddard, are the whispers of hidden intentions. Can you hear them in the North?
Eddard: In the North, Tyrion, the silence often carries the howl of the wind, not whispers of hidden intentions. How do you discern these whispers amidst the clamor of King's Landing?
Tyrion: In King's Landing, Eddard, the whispers are the clamor. Can you not hear the wind's secrets in the North?
Eddard: The wind in the North speaks of winter, Tyrion, not of hidden intentions. How do you distinguish truth from deceit in these whispers?
Tyrion: Truth or deceit, Eddard, is often a matter of perspective. How do you interpret the winter's howl in the North?
Eddard: The winter's howl, Tyrion, is a stark reminder of the harsh realities we face, not a whisper of hidden intentions. How do you navigate the whispers of hidden intentions, Tyrion?
Tyrion: I listen closely, Eddard. The whispers often reveal more than the shouts.
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion, but whispers can be misleading. How do you ensure you're not led astray by them?
Tyrion: By questioning their source, Eddard. How do you ensure the howls of the North don't mislead you?
Eddard: By trusting in the constancy of their nature, Tyrion. The North's howls, unlike whispers, do not change with the wind.
Tyrion: Constancy, Eddard? Even the most steadfast howl can be muffled by a sudden snowstorm, can it not?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion, a snowstorm can muffle a howl, but it does not change its nature. How do you maintain your nature amidst the whispers and clamor?
Tyrion: By keeping my wits sharp and my tongue sharper, Eddard. How do you keep your integrity intact in the harsh North?
Eddard: By staying true to my principles, Tyrion, and leading by example. How do you ensure your wits and tongue don't lead you astray?
Tyrion: By never letting them sleep, Eddard. How do you keep your principles from freezing in the North's cold?
Eddard: By keeping them close to my heart, Tyrion. How do you keep your wits sharp amidst the constant dance?
Tyrion: With a keen eye and a sharper mind, Eddard. How do you keep your heart warm in the North's cold?
Eddard: Through the warmth of my family and the loyalty of my people, Tyrion. How do you keep your mind sharp amidst the South's heat?
Tyrion: By staying in the shade of knowledge, Eddard. How do you keep your heart from freezing in the North's cold?
