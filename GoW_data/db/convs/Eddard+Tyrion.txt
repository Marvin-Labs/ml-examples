Tyrion: Greetings, Eddard. How fares the North?

Eddard: The North remains steadfast, Tyrion. How do things fare in the South?

Tyrion: The South is a viper's nest, Eddard. How fares your bastard son at the Wall?

<address> | How is Jon faring at the Wall? 0
Eddard: Jon is adapting to the harsh conditions, learning much from the Night's Watch. Have you heard any news from the Wall, Tyrion?

Tyrion: Indeed, Mormont mentioned the awakening enemy beyond the Wall. He seeks aid from the court.

<address> | What kind of aid does Mormont seek from the court? 0
Eddard: What form of aid does Mormont request?

<address> | What kind of support does Mormont seek from the court? 0
Tyrion: Mormont seeks men and resources to fortify the Wall against the awakening enemy.

<resolved> | Mormont seeks men and resources to fortify the Wall against the awakening enemy. 0
Eddard: The North can provide men, but resources are scarce. Can the South lend aid?

<resolved> | Mormont seeks men and resources from the court to fortify the Wall against the awakening enemy. 0
Tyrion: The South is a viper's nest, Eddard. Resources are plentiful, but trust is scarce.

Eddard: Perhaps we can convince King Robert to lend aid, given the gravity of the threat beyond the Wall?

Tyrion: King Robert might be swayed, but convincing the court is another matter entirely.

Eddard: Indeed, the court is a challenge. But Robert's word carries weight, and as his Hand, I can lend my voice to the cause.

Tyrion: Robert's word may carry weight, but the court's purse strings are held by others. Can the treasury afford such an expense?

<address> | How can we convince the court to provide the necessary resources for the Wall? 1
Eddard: The treasury's state is indeed a concern. Perhaps we could propose a plan that minimizes the financial burden while maximizing the effectiveness of the aid?

Tyrion: A plan, you say? Well, Eddard, do you have any ingenious ideas to squeeze blood from the stone that is our treasury?

Eddard: Perhaps we could divert funds from less urgent projects or seek aid from our allies?

<resolved> | The South has plentiful resources but trust is scarce, making it difficult to lend aid to the Wall. 1
QUD: Which less urgent projects could we divert funds from to aid the Wall?
Tyrion: Diverting funds, you say? Perhaps the extravagant royal feasts could be made a tad less lavish.


Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. A modest feast would still honor our guests, and the saved funds could fortify the Wall.


Tyrion: Perhaps we could also reconsider the cost of the royal hunts. They are quite the drain on the treasury.


Eddard: A wise suggestion, Tyrion. The royal hunts are indeed costly. The funds saved could be used to strengthen the Wall.


Tyrion: Perhaps the court's extravagant wardrobe could also use a trim. Do we truly need new silks for every feast?

<address> | What are the potential consequences if we fail to convince the court to provide the necessary resources for the Wall? 1
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. The court's wardrobe is another area where we could cut costs. The threat beyond the Wall is far more pressing than new silks.

Tyrion: Perhaps the court could also reconsider the cost of gifts. Do we truly need Valyrian steel daggers for every occasion?

Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. Valyrian steel daggers are a luxury, not a necessity. The funds could be better used to support the Wall.

<resolved> | Funds could be diverted from less urgent projects such as royal feasts, hunts, the court's wardrobe, and the cost of gifts like Valyrian steel daggers to aid the Wall. 2
QUD:
Tyrion: Indeed, Eddard. But let's not forget, those daggers can be quite persuasive in the right hands. Could their influence be worth the cost?


Eddard: The influence of a Valyrian steel dagger can indeed be persuasive, Tyrion. But the cost of a failed Wall could be far greater.

<resolved> | Funds could be diverted from less urgent projects such as royal feasts, hunts, the court's wardrobe, and the cost of gifts like Valyrian steel daggers to aid the Wall. 3


Deducing implications...


QUD: "Considering the scarcity of trust in the South and the urgent need for resources at the Wall, could we not propose a system where the court's less urgent expenditures, such as royal feasts, hunts, and extravagant gifts like Valyrian steel daggers, are made contingent on their contribution to the Wall's defense, thereby incentivizing the nobility to invest in the Wall's fortification?"
Tyrion: True, Eddard. But perhaps the persuasive power of a Valyrian steel dagger could be used to convince those who hold the purse strings?


Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. But if we fail to convince them, the Wall may fall, and the realm will face the awakened enemy.


Tyrion: Then we must not fail, Eddard. The realm's survival depends on our cunning, not just our coin.

<resolved> | If the court is not convinced to provide the necessary resources for the Wall, the Wall may fall, and the realm will face the awakened enemy. 1
QUD: How would the court react if we proposed to cut costs on their luxuries to fund the Wall, given that they are not directly affected by the threat beyond the Wall?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. We must use our cunning to convince the court of the necessity of these sacrifices. Do you believe they will understand the gravity of the threat beyond the Wall?

<resolved> | The court's less urgent expenditures, such as royal feasts, hunts, and extravagant gifts like Valyrian steel daggers, could be made contingent on their contribution to the Wall's defense, thereby incentivizing the nobility to invest in the Wall's fortification. 3


Deducing implications...


QUD: "Considering the scarcity of trust in the South and the urgent need for resources at the Wall, could we not propose a system where the court's extravagant spending on feasts, hunts, wardrobes, and gifts like Valyrian steel daggers is redirected to fortify the Wall, thereby demonstrating the court's commitment and rebuilding trust?"
Tyrion: Understanding the threat and acting on it are two different beasts, Eddard. The court is more concerned with power games than the realm's safety.


Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. The court's games of power are a distraction. But perhaps the threat of the awakened enemy could be used to sway them?

Picking a new topic...


QUD: Eddard, how do you think your son Jon is adjusting to life at the Wall and his role in the Night's Watch?
Tyrion: Perhaps, Eddard. But tell me, how is Jon coping with the harsh realities of the Night's Watch?


Eddard: Jon is showing resilience, learning to lead and survive. How do you think the court would react to his potential leadership at the Wall?

<address> | How do you think the court would react to Jon's potential leadership at the Wall? 0
QUD: How do you think the court would react to Jon's potential leadership at the Wall?
Tyrion: The court, Eddard, is more likely to sneer at a bastard's rise than applaud it. But then, they've always underestimated the underdogs, haven't they?


Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. The court may sneer, but Jon's potential leadership could be the very underdog victory we need to rally support for the Wall.


Tyrion: Jon's leadership might indeed rally support, but remember, Eddard, the court loves a spectacle. Could his bastard status be used to our advantage?

<resolved> | The court may resist cutting costs on their luxuries to fund the Wall, as they are more concerned with power games and their own comfort than the realm's safety. However, the threat of the awakened enemy and the potential leadership of Jon Snow at the Wall could be used to sway them. 2
QUD: What can be done to provide the necessary aid to the Wall?
Eddard: Perhaps, Tyrion. Jon's status as a bastard could indeed create a spectacle that draws the court's attention to the Wall's plight.


Tyrion: A spectacle, indeed. But remember, Eddard, the court loves a good underdog story. Jon's rise could be just the drama they need to pay attention.

<resolved> | The court may resist cutting costs on their luxuries to fund the Wall, as they are more concerned with power games and their own comfort than the realm's safety. However, the threat of the awakened enemy and the potential leadership of Jon Snow at the Wall could be used to sway them. 3
QUD: How is Jon faring at the Wall?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. Jon's resilience and leadership could indeed make for a compelling tale. Has the court shown interest in such stories before?

<address> | How has the court reacted to underdog stories in the past? 0
Tyrion: The court does love a good underdog story, Eddard. But they're fickle, their interest fleeting unless the tale serves their interests.


Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. Jon's story could serve their interests, showing the court that even a bastard can rise to leadership and defend the realm.


Tyrion: The court does enjoy a good spectacle, Eddard. But remember, they're more interested in the spectacle's benefits than the spectacle itself.


Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. If Jon's leadership at the Wall can bring tangible benefits to the realm, it might just be the spectacle the court needs to invest in.

<resolved> | The court enjoys a good underdog story, but their interest is fleeting unless the tale serves their interests. 0
QUD: "Speaking of underdogs, Jon's rise to leadership at the Wall is indeed a compelling tale. But have there been other instances in the realm where bastards or underdogs have risen to power and made significant contributions?"
Tyrion: Indeed, Eddard. But remember, the court's interest is fickle. They'll need more than just a spectacle. They'll need proof of Jon's worth.


Eddard: Jon's worth is evident in his dedication and leadership at the Wall. Has the court shown interest in such qualities before?

Tyrion: Indeed, Eddard. The court has shown interest in such qualities when they serve their interests. Remember, my appointment as acting Hand by Tywin?

<resolved> | Jon is showing resilience and leadership at the Wall, which could potentially be used to sway the court's interest and support for the Wall. 3
QUD: How can we convince the court to provide the necessary resources for the Wall?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. Your appointment as Hand did serve their interests. Could we not argue that supporting the Wall also serves the realm's interests?

Tyrion: Indeed, Eddard. My appointment as Hand did serve their interests, but remember, it was not without its challenges and prejudices.

<resolved> | The court may resist cutting costs on their luxuries to fund the Wall, as they are more concerned with power games and their own comfort than the realm's safety. However, the threat of the awakened enemy and the potential leadership of Jon Snow at the Wall could be used to sway them. 3
QUD:
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. Your challenges as Hand were many. But, could we not use those experiences to navigate the court's prejudices and rally support for the Wall?

<address> | "Tyrion, you mentioned your appointment as acting Hand by Tywin. How did the court react to your appointment, given your status as a dwarf?" 1
QUD: "Tyrion, you mentioned your appointment as acting Hand by Tywin. How did the court react to your appointment, given your status as a dwarf?"
Tyrion: The court's reaction was mixed, Eddard. Some saw my intellect, others only my stature. But tell me, how did the North react to Jon's appointment at the Wall?

<keep> 3
QUD:
Eddard: The North respects strength and resilience, Tyrion. Jon's appointment was met with approval, for they see his potential.

<resolved> | The court's reaction to Tyrion's appointment as Hand was mixed, with some recognizing his intellect while others focused on his stature. 1
QUD: How does the court perceive the threat beyond the Wall?
Tyrion: Interesting. And how did the court react to Jon's appointment, Eddard?

Eddard: The court's reaction was mixed, Tyrion. Some saw potential, others only his bastard status.


Tyrion: The court's perception is often swayed by spectacle and self-interest, Eddard. Has Jon's potential been demonstrated in a way that could serve their interests?

Eddard: Jon has shown great leadership and resilience at the Wall, qualities that could serve the realm well. Could these not be of interest to the court?


Tyrion: The court values leadership and resilience, Eddard, but only when it serves their interests. Has Jon done anything that could directly benefit them?

<resolved> | The court may resist cutting costs on their luxuries to fund the Wall, as they are more concerned with power games and their own comfort than the realm's safety. However, the threat of the awakened enemy and the potential leadership of Jon Snow at the Wall could be used to sway them. 3


Deducing implications...


QUD: "Considering the court's resistance to fund the Wall due to their focus on power games and comfort, and given the imminent threat of the awakened enemy, could we leverage the potential leadership of Jon Snow at the Wall to create a narrative that would not only convince the court to provide the necessary resources, but also unite the realm under a common cause, thus shifting the power dynamics in our favor?"
Eddard: Jon has been training the Night's Watch recruits, improving their combat skills. Could this not be seen as strengthening the realm's defense?


Tyrion: Indeed, Eddard. But remember, the court is more interested in the spectacle of power than the practicality of defense.

Eddard: True, Tyrion. But perhaps the spectacle of power could be Jon leading the defense against the awakened enemy, a spectacle that also serves practical defense.

<resolved> | The court perceives the threat beyond the Wall with skepticism, focusing more on power games and self-interest. However, they may be swayed by a compelling underdog story or a spectacle that serves their interests. 2
QUD: How do you think the court would react to Jon's potential leadership at the Wall?
Tyrion: A spectacle indeed, Eddard. But remember, the court's interest is as fickle as a summer breeze. Will they see Jon's leadership as a sign of strength, or merely another bastard's folly?

Eddard: Perhaps, Tyrion. But Jon's leadership could also be seen as a testament to his character, overcoming his bastard status to defend the realm. Could this not sway the court's perception?

<resolved> | The court's reaction to Jon's potential leadership at the Wall would likely be mixed, with some recognizing his leadership and resilience while others focusing on his bastard status. However, they may be swayed by a compelling underdog story or a spectacle that serves their interests. 3
QUD: "Speaking of underdogs, Jon's rise to leadership at the Wall is indeed a compelling tale. But have there been other instances in the realm where bastards or underdogs have risen to power and made significant contributions?"
Tyrion: Perhaps, Eddard. But remember, my own rise to Hand was met with mixed reactions. The court's perception is a fickle beast.

<resolved> | Jon Snow's potential leadership at the Wall could be used to create a narrative that might convince the court to provide the necessary resources for the Wall and unite the realm under a common cause. However, the court's interest is fickle and often swayed by spectacle and self-interest. Therefore, the success of this strategy is uncertain. 3


Deducing implications...


QUD: "Considering the court's resistance to fund the Wall due to their focus on power games and comfort, and given the imminent threat of the awakened enemy, could we leverage the potential leadership of Jon Snow at the Wall to rally public support and pressure the court into reallocating resources for the Wall's fortification?"
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. But as you've shown, even amidst mixed reactions, one can still serve the realm effectively. Could not Jon do the same at the Wall?

Tyrion: Indeed, Eddard. But remember, Jon's bastard status may be a hurdle in the court's eyes, just as my stature was for me.

Eddard: True, Tyrion. But Jon's status could also serve as a symbol of overcoming adversity. Could not the court respect such resilience?

Tyrion: Indeed, Eddard. But remember, my own rise to Hand was met with mixed reactions. The court's respect is not easily earned, especially for those of us born under less than ideal circumstances.

<resolved> | The court's interest in power games and comfort may hinder the reallocation of resources for the Wall's fortification. However, leveraging Jon Snow's potential leadership at the Wall could rally public support and pressure the court into action. 3


Picking a new topic...


QUD: Tyrion, how do you think the dynamics of the court will change now that Robert is no longer king and Joffrey is set to take the throne?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. With Joffrey set to take the throne, how do you foresee the court's dynamics shifting?

<address> | How do you think Joffrey's ascension to the throne will affect the court's dynamics? 3
Tyrion: Joffrey's reign will likely amplify the court's power games, Eddard. His volatile nature could make the court even more unpredictable.

<address> | How do you think Joffrey's volatile nature will affect the court's power games? 0
Eddard: Joffrey's volatility could indeed intensify the court's power games, making alliances more precarious. Do you think this could hinder our efforts to secure aid for the Wall?

<address> | How do you think Joffrey's volatile nature will affect the court's dynamics? 3
Tyrion: Joffrey's volatility could indeed complicate matters, Eddard. His unpredictable nature might make our allies hesitant to commit resources to the Wall.


Eddard: Joffrey's volatile nature could indeed make our allies hesitant, Tyrion. But perhaps we could use this unpredictability to our advantage, keeping our enemies off balance while we fortify the Wall.


Tyrion: Joffrey's unpredictability could indeed keep our enemies off balance, Eddard. But remember, it could also alienate our allies, making them less likely to lend aid to the Wall.


Eddard: Joffrey's volatile nature could indeed strain alliances, Tyrion. But perhaps his unpredictability could also deter potential threats, giving us time to fortify the Wall.

<address> | How do you think Joffrey's volatile nature will affect our efforts to secure aid for the Wall? 3
Tyrion: Joffrey's unpredictability might deter threats, Eddard, but it could also deter potential allies. Can we afford to gamble the Wall's defense on his volatile nature?


Eddard: Joffrey's volatile nature is indeed a gamble, Tyrion. But perhaps his unpredictability could be used to keep potential threats guessing, buying us time to fortify the Wall.


Tyrion: Joffrey's unpredictability might keep threats guessing, Eddard, but it could also make our allies unpredictable. Can we risk that?

<resolved> | Joffrey's volatile nature could complicate the court's power games, potentially straining alliances and making allies hesitant to commit resources to the Wall. However, his unpredictability could also deter potential threats and keep them guessing, buying time to fortify the Wall. 0
QUD: How does Joffrey's volatile nature affect his relationship with his siblings, particularly Tommen and Myrcella?
Eddard: Indeed, Tyrion. Joffrey's unpredictability is a risk. But perhaps we can manage it, ensuring it doesn't alienate our allies while still keeping our enemies guessing.
