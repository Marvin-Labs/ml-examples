Eddard Stark, also known as Ned Stark, is the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. He is a man of honor and integrity, deeply committed to justice and the well-being of his family. Eddard is married to Catelyn Stark, and they have five children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon. He also has a ward, Theon Greyjoy, and is believed to have fathered a bastard son, Jon, with which he has a close relationship. Eddard is a childhood friend of King Robert Baratheon, which leads to his appointment as Hand.

Eddard executed a deserter from the Watch who claims to have seen the Others bring corpses to life.
Eddard Stark became the Hand for Robert Baratheon.
He investigated Jon Arryn's (the previous Hand) death and discovered the illegitimacy of the royal children.
He did so by tracing Jon's steps, and finding out that he was reading a book about the Baretheon's lineage.
He keeps tracing back Jon Arryn's steps and finds various bastards of Robert, which all have black hair.
By cross referencing this info with what he finds in the book, he realized that Baratheons always have black hair, unlike Cersei's chidlren.
So he infered they are probably not Robert's.
He was visited in secret by Catelyn, his wife, who tells him about the attempted murder of Bran using a Valyrian Steel dagger with a Dragonbone hilt.
Eddard confronted Cersei Lannister about her children's parentage. She warns him to back off.
Robert is mortally wounded. On his deathbed he gives Eddard a note declaring him regent until Jeoffrey comes of age.
Petyr promises Eddard that he can muster the support of the City Guard.
Encouraged by this promise, he approached Cersei and Jeoffrey with Robert's note, but he found out that Petyr was lying.
He was arrested.
